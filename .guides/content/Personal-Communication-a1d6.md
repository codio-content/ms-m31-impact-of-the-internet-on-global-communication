The internet is the most recent in a long line of advances in personal communication. 

Previous advancements included postal systems, telephones, and even photographs. Being able to send letters, make phone calls, and eventually send pictures to people in other locations allowed us to communicate with friends and family across the globe.

## Drawbacks of Previous Methods

While writing letters and making phone calls did connect people to each other, they had downfalls. Reading a letter gives information about what is going on, but it does not always make us feel like we know the person writing the letter personally or feel like they are similar to us. Sometimes, it can even make the person seem further away or like they are very different from us. The length of time between responses makes the distance seem very far as well.

The same can be said about phone calls. They allow people who are far away to talk to each other, but sometimes they make it seem like the other person is too far away to understand how it feels to be where you are. Even though the response is immediate, it is still hard to forget that the person on the phone is far away.


## Benefits of the Internet

With the internet, we not only have instant communication, we have ongoing communication. Instead of being limited to one phone call or a picture sent with a letter in the mail, we can communicate all day with email or instant messages. We can also send pictures and videos back and forth to see what the other person sees in their everyday lives. Instead of the distance feeling farther and farther, the internet has caused the world to seem very small. With video calls, we can talk face to face with someone else anywhere on the globe. We can see what is going on around them and understand their world and how it feels to be there. This has created closer and more personal relationships between people across the world. 

With instant, ongoing communication, people are able to share small details about what is happening in their lives and how they feel about it and receive responses from others around the world. This creates a close bond and causes people to understand each other more, no matter where they are.

## Social Interaction

People have always been separated by location. They have also been separated by their interests and beliefs. The internet doesn't get rid of these separations, but it gives everyone a place to meet each other. In the past, someone who was very different from those around them would feel alone and isolated, but the internet gives them a way to find others like them and communicate with those people, creating meaningful friendships.
